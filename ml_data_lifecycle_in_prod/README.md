# Machine Learning Data Lifeycle in Production


## Week1 - Collecting, Labeling and Validating Data
* Describe the differences between ML modeling and a production ML system
* Identify responsible data collection for building a fair production ML system
* Discuss data and concept change and how to address it by annotating new training data with direct labeling and/or human labeling
* Address training data issues by generating dataset statistics and creating, comparing and updating data schemasa

## Week2 - Feature Engineering, Transformation and Selection
* Define a set of feature engineering techniques, such as scaling and binning
* Use TensorFlow Transform for a simple preprocessing and data transformation task
* Describe feature space coverage and implement different feature selection methods
* Perform feature selection using scikit-learn routines and ensure feature space coverage

## Week3 - Data Journey and Data Storage
* Describe data journey through data lineage and provenance
* Integrate the sequence of pipeline artifacts into metadata storage using ML Metadata library
* Iteratively create enterprise data schema
* Explain how to integrate enterprise data into feature stores, data warehouses and data lakes

## Week4 - Advanced Labeling, Augmentation and Data Preprocessing
* Discuss direct, semi-supervised, weak supervision and active learning methods for labeling data
* Increase the diversity of your training set by data augmentation
* Perform advanced data preparation and transformation on different structured and unstructured data types
