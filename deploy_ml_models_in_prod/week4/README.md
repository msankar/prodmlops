# Model Management and Delivery

* Manage, monitor and audit your projects during their entire lifecycle
* Establish procedures to detect model decay and prevent reduced accuracy
* Implement modern practices to trace your ML system including monitoring and logging
* Integrate mechanisms to your production systems to ensure that they comply with modern responsible AI practices and legal regulations
* Determine when is appropriate and how to apply techniques to protect users privacy and respect their right to be forgotten
